This project generates mazes. It serves as the final project for CMPS-2200.

The program uses a collection of random graphs, drawn via Pigale.
We parse the parse the graphs as Networkx graphs.
Then, we calculate a spanning tree of "open" edges that form a maze. We can throw in some extra open edges too.
The maze object contains this physical maze along with the locations of the nodes.
We also keep track of a "known maze" that encodes the part of the maze that has been explored.
Finally, we have a "hero" class that keeps track of distance traveled and deadends hit.

The algorithms to implement for the project belong in maze_solve_algorithms and maze.

Here, we give an overview of the files and the notable classes and functions in each file. The files are listed in order, so that each file imports all of the previous files. The students must write the functions labeled with *.
